r"""Populate and update several automatically maintained groups in Cerebrum.

The complete specification of this script is in
cerebrum-sites/doc/intern/felles/utvikling/auto-grupper-spesifikasjon.rst.

A few salient points:

* This script synchronizes (i.e. creates, changes memberships, deletes)
  several groups based on the information already found in
  Cerebrum. Technically, it duplicates information otherwise available;
  however having these groups will make a number of tasks considerably easier.

* All such automatic groups are tagged with special traits (trait_auto_group,
  trait_auto_meta_group). Only such automatic groups can have these
  trait. Beware! If you give these traits to *any* other group, it will be
  collected by this script and probably deleted (as no OU would be
  'associated' with it). Autogroups with human members are tagged with
  trait_auto_group; metagroups (autogroups with group members) are tagged with
  trait_auto_meta_group.

* Some groups have people as members (person_ids), or their primary account if
  the --account switch is turned on; others have other automatic groups as
  members.

* ansatt-<sko>, ansatt-vitenskapelig-<sko>, ansatt-tekadm-<sko>,
  ansatt-bilag-<sko> have person_id as members. They contain the employees (of
  the given type) at the specified OU. If a person_id is a member of
  ansatt-vitenskapelig, ansatt-tekadm or ansatt-bilag, (s)he is also a member
  of ansatt-<sko>.

* meta-ansatt-<sko1> are 'metagroups' in a sense. They contain other employee
  groups (specifically ansatt-<sko2>, where sko2 is sko1 or its child in the
  specified hierarchy). At the very least meta-ansatt-<sko1> will have one
  member -- ansatt-<sko1>. Should sko1 have any child OUs with employees, the
  for each such child OU sko2, meta-ansatt-<sko1> will have a member
  ansatt-<sko2>.

A typical run for UiO would be something like this:

populate-automatic-groups.py --dryrun -s system_sap -p SAP \\
        -c affiliation_status_ansatt_vitenskapelig:ansatt-vitenskapelig \\
        -c affiliation_status_ansatt_tekadm:ansatt-tekadm \\
        -c affiliation_status_ansatt_bil:ansatt-bilag \\
        -c affiliation_ansatt:ansatt

If you want to look at the resulting structure, issue this:

populate-automatic-groups.py -p SAP -o

... or, if you want to see which groups exist for sko 13-xx-xx and 33-15-xx
and how they are structured:

populate-automatic-groups.py -p SAP -o -f '^13' -f '^3315'

    -p --perspective SYSTEM     Set the system perspective to fetch the OU
                                structure from, e.g. SAP or FS. This sets what
                                system that controls the OU hierarchy which
                                should be used for the group hierarchy.

    -s --source_system SYSTEM   Set the source system to fetch the person
                                affiliations from. Could be a single system or
                                a list of systems. Defaults to 'system_sap'.

    -c --collect CRITERIA       Update the select criterias for what
                                affiliations or statuses that shoul be
                                collected and used for populating auto groups.
                                Note that this comes in addition to what is set
                                in the mapping in cereconf.AUTOMATIC_GROUPS.

                                Format: The aff or status must be tailed with a
                                colon and what group prefix to use. Example:

                                    affilation_status_tilknyttet_eremitus:auto-eremitus

    -a --accounts               Populate the groups with primary accounts
                                instead of persons.

    -r --spread PREFIX:SPREAD   Add a spread to the auto groups. Each given
                                spread must have a prefix that must match the
                                start of the group name for the spread to be
                                given. Examples:

                                   ansatt:group@ad # Each group starting with
                                                   # "ansatt..." will get to
                                                   # AD.

                                   :group@ldap # All groups will get to LDAP,
                                               # since the prefix is blank and
                                               # will match all groups.

    --omit-spread SPREAD        These spreads will be ommitted from
                                syncronization.
                                In other words, they won't be touched.  Should
                                be specified in the same way as for --spread.

    --remove-all-auto-groups    Delete all auto groups, which means all groups
                                that has the autogroup trait.

    -o --output-groups          Print out the group forest of auto groups and
                                quit, without doing any changes.

    -f --filters                Add an output filter that is used for finding
                                the root OUs that are used when printing out
                                the forest - see --output-groups.

    -d --dryrun                 Do not commit the changes.

    -h --help                   Show this and quit.
