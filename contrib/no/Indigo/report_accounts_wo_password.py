Usage:
      new_accounts_wo_pass.py [-t | --time]
                              [-f | --file [PATH/]FILENAME]
                              [-h | --help]

      Where:
       -t or --time is an optional argument that is the number of days to go
                    back to in time in order to look for all the accounts that
                    were created after it  but that still didn't get a password

                    Default is 180 days.
       -f or --file is an optional argument to dump the output in a file with
                    an explicit or implicit system path pointing to the file.
                    Default is dump the output to stdout.
       -l or --list is an optional argument to narrow down the search to a list
                    of usernames read from a file with an explicit or implicit
                    system path.
       -h or --help shows this message and all the above text and quits.
