"""
This file is an UiO-specific extension of the Cerebrum framework.

Specifically, it ensures that all people that should have spread 'UA@uio'
actually do so.

The rules run like this:

* Every student should have spread 'UA@uio'
* Every employee should have spread 'UA@uio'.
  (NB! *any* employment would do, not necessarily an active one)

However, the student processing job at UiO (studentautomatikken) ensures
that all the *students* get the proper spread. Thus this job deals with all
the rest.

Specifically, the following updates are run:

* Give spread 'UA@uio' to all employees (i.e. persons having an employment
  (tilsetting) record.)
