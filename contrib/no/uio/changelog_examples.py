# Examples:
# In this example there are two optional input parameters;
# 'after_date' and 'before_date'. If you use none(don't do that unless
# you want ALL your created users!), after_date or both of those, you
# don't need to specify them in the call, but if you want all users
# created before date X, you have to include 'before_date=' in the
# call.
# Ex:

# Find all users created between 2003-07-01 and 2003-07-22:
list_new_users('2003-07-01', '2003-07-22')

# Same as above, but here we specify which parameter is which:
list_new_users(after_date='2003-07-01',before_date='2003-07-22')

# List users created before 2003-07-25. In this example you have to
# include 'before_date='
list_new_users(before_date='2003-07-25')

# List users created after 2003-07-01
list_new_users('2003-07-01')

# If unsure whether you should include 'before_date=' and
# 'after_date=' in your search, include.
