"""
This script creates (or reactivates) an account for a person with specified
affiliation.

Originally NMH used process_students.py to automatically create employee
(those with affiliation=TILKNYTTET) accounts. However, NMH migrated to SAP for
employment data which makes it difficult for process_students.py to create any
accounts for those who are employees only.

Thus, thus script scans for people who:

  - Have at least one specified affiliation (there may be several)
  - Do not have an account at all or
    Have an expired account or
    Have an active account without the specified affiliations

Having collected such people, the script either creates a new account (as if
by bofh's user_create) or re-activates an expired one. Reactivation in this
case means:

- Removing expire date
- Assigning correct affiliations (copy from person)
- Assigning proper spread (cereconf.BOFHD_NEW_USER_SPREADS)

Whether an account has been created or re-activated, it gets a new password
(this would be a password unknown to all not having access to change_log)

Should an account already exist AND be active, it'd receive a copy of the
affiliations from the person owner.

Typical usage pattern would be to create/reactive accounts for SAP-employees:
