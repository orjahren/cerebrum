"""This script produces a dump of all new accounts' usernames and their
plaintext passwords, and another dump with those who have changed their
password. This is not a recommended way of "syncing" passwords for an instance,
but it is unfortunately necessary if some systems doesn't handle automatic syncs
yet.

The format for both the dump files are:

    username;full_name;password

Note that passwords could contain semi colons themselves. You can expect that
usernames do not contain semi colons, but if a name contains a semi colon, it
will be substituted by a colon (:). TODO: what's the best solution for semi
colons in names?
