"""The core functionality for SOAP services running in the CIS framework. CIS
is based on the twisted framework and rpclib (now called spyne).

This file contains the main parts that are needed for a basic setup of a new
CIS service. The new service itself has to be created in its own file, and be
given to a TwistedSoapStarter class. Other settings are available, e.g. to
apply SSL encryption, authentication and authorization.

The structure is:

- The L{Server} is run, and sets up the webservice. It is normally located in
  servers/cis/.

- The L{Server} imports the proper L{Service} class and instantiates it. This
  contains the main functionality for the service, and could be defined in
  Cerebrum/modules/cis/ or be in a local instance' code directory.

- The L{Server} defines (or imports) a L{Service Framework} for what commands
  that are available, and how to communicate with the L{Service}. The L{Service
  Framework} is normally a subclass of L{BasicSoapStarter} from this file.

# Hacks at Soaplib/Twisted
# Below is collections of different hacks of the soaplib and twisted to fix
# certain behaviour as we want. It should be put here to be able to locate any
# changes when upgrading to newer versions of the packages.

# Modifying the logger to work with Cerebrum
# Note that Twisted Core 11.1.0 and later supports log prefixes:
#   - Protocols may now implement ILoggingContext to customize their
#     logging prefix.  twisted.protocols.policies.ProtocolWrapper and the
#     endpoints wrapper now take advantage of this feature to ensure the
#     application protocol is still reflected in logs. (#5062)
# which means that this can be removed when upgrading to later twisted
# versions.
