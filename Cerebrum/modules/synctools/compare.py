    This is a base implementation of how comparisons
    of data from Cerebrum and an external system should take place.
    Entity data from both systems should be built into dicts with matching
    attributes, and then compared.
    Most syncs will probably however need more a granularized comparison
    logic, which should take place before preferably calling this function
    in the end.

    Compares the passed attributes on two dicts, and returns True if they
    are all equal, and False if not.
