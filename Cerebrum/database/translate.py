       translate placeholders, and to register expected placeholders so that we
       can verify that our query gets all its expected parameters/bindings.

# TODO: Optimize caching
# ----------------------
# We could get a significant speedup in services that re-create a database
# object often by moving the Translator cache *outside* of the Translator
# object, as each db cursor has its own object/cache.
#
# If implemented, we'd have to handle that:
#
# - Different dialects should use different caches
# - Statement translation may change if the dialect.macro_table changes
# - Statement translation may change if the dialect.param_cls changes
# - Statement translation may change if the macro context changes
#   ([:get_constant], [:get_config]).
#
# Also, if cache is moved to e.g. module level or another thread shared object,
# we must remember to protect cache access with threading locks (i.e. wrap
# everyting between cache lookup to potential cache update in a
# `with cache_lock` threading.Lock context manager).
