# This could be a global logging file for Cerebrum.  All messages of
# level WARN and above are logged to a central log, while the various
# applications may use different logg-levels and files.  For testing,
# the console logger can be used.  It doesn't propagate log messages.
#
# Note: When propagating messages to other loggers, the handler level
# is used to determine wheter to log or not. For a logger propagating
# messages to its parent, do NOT set the level to NOTSET (otherwise
# the logger will assume the level of its parent.
