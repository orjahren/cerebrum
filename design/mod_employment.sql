 * Tables used by Cerebrum.modules.no.PersonEmployment
 *
 * This file is a Cerebrum extesion for tracking some of the employment
 * related data.
 *
 * Although affiliations could be used as a generic way of keeping track of
 * some of the employments, the available tables are insufficient to record
 * all the details we need. This module rectifies that.
 *
 * Note that this module exists parallel to the affiliations
 * registration. There is no connection (say, in a form of a foreign key)
 * between the two. It's like that by design.
